<h2>Rules:</h2><br>
#0 Listen to the admins. They’re always right. Unless they’re wrong. Then they’re double right.
<br>
#1 You’re here to have fun. Don’t go out of your way to make anyone else miserable, and do what you can to create an enjoyable experience. 
<br>
#2 You are expected to play the role you sign in as. An NCR soldier should behave as such. A Wastelander should not be some all encompassing specialist. Stick to your gimmick. 
<br>
#3 Don’t powergame. If it’s more than you need and you don’t need it, don’t take it.
<br>
#4 Don’t Kill on Sight. The wastes are a dangerous place, but you’re not crazy murderhobos. Roleplay out your bloodlust. Then murder away. (Legion and NCR are exempt from this rule, ONLY in relation to one another.)
<br>
#5 Don’t hesitate to Ahelp, whether a mundane issue or being murdered by a random waster with no interaction. We also enable gimmicks, if you ask.
<br>
#6 For fuck's sake QUIT GIVING YOUR CHARACTER MEME NAMES
<br>
