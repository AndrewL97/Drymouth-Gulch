<i><b>This server takes place before the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.

<i>This server is running Fallout13 Legacy code, which is based on fairly old /tg/code. We've purged the whitelist from the code, and crank out updates to keep the old girl working every now and then, but our main focus is currently on a rebase.</i>
